Openconfig KNE
https://github.com/openconfig/kne
0.1.7 December 2022
Defines a container format proposed for vendors to build appliances based on their own software
"The idea of this project is to provide a standard "interface" so that vendors can produce a standard container implementation which can be used to build complex topologies."

Jorge Garc√≠a created the Educational Network Simulator. It is a very simple educational network simulator intended to be used with his 15-16 year old students. Jorge provides a series of YouTube videos explaining how it works and how to use it.
