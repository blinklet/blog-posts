## DiskCache

https://github.com/grantjenks/python-diskcache

PythonBytes episode #217

Python disk-backed cache (Django-compatible). Faster than Redis and Memcached. Pure-Python. The cloud-based computing of 2020 puts a premium on memory. Gigabytes of empty space is left on disks as processes vie for memory. Among these processes is Memcached (and sometimes Redis) which is used as a cache. Wouldn't it be nice to leverage empty disk space for caching?
