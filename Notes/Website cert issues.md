Certificate error
Looks like the three domains below are not set up with forwarding. But they still seem to be redirecting to bluehost...
I reconfigured forwarding but still have the same problem
I see that these three are set up with bluehost name servers

Hang ups
Looks like the two domains below are set up with forwarding, but forwarding is not working?
I see these three are set up with hover name servers

I went to bluehost account and clicked on view domains. I ass that bluehost is managing four domains, one of which is brianlinkletter.com and the other three are the three with the cert errors.

When I click on one of the 3 domains, I see it is not connected to any services.

I clicked on "Add" to add a service. It shows I have one service available to add, my Wordpress blog

I clicked Connect but it gave confusing directions
"Connect opensourcenetworksimulator.com domain to your WordPress Plus Hosting hosting package on the next screen. Select the website you would like to add this domain, click on "Manage," and then select "Domains" to complete the setup." 
and then there was another connect button

Clicking on connect just sent me to the hosting panel, which displayed a message:

"Select a site below to start domain connection
Select a site below and navigate to the Domains menu item, or you can start fresh by installing a new instance of WordPress Add WordPress Site"

I clicked on "websites"

I saw my Wordpress site. I clicked on "Manage"

Then I clicked on Domains tab

I clicked on Add Domain

I entered "opensourcenetworksimulators.com" and clicked Continue

This brough me back to Hosting and asked me to finish the connectiomn

I clicke on that button and then in the next screen clicked on "Save Changes"

I was brought back to the hosting wwindow and saw the connected domains, wit the new on "in progress"


DNS takes a while to propagate so I waited a bit before trying the other domains
