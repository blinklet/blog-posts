Batfish as a network simulator?
https://github.com/batfish/batfish
Batfish builds complete models of network behavior from device configurations and finds violations of network policies (built-in, user-defined, and best-practices).

    In Lab 1, youâ€™ll explore the basics of NVIDIA Cumulus Linux and Network Command Line Utility (NCLU) before building your workbench. Lab 2 is all about network interfaces and connectivity. Finally, Lab 3 dives into layer-3 routing features, Free Range Routing (FRR), and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) unnumbered.
