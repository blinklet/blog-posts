Batfish as a network simulator?
https://github.com/batfish/batfish
Batfish builds complete models of network behavior from device configurations and finds violations of network policies (built-in, user-defined, and best-practices).

    In Lab 1, you’ll explore the basics of NVIDIA Cumulus Linux and Network Command Line Utility (NCLU) before building your workbench. Lab 2 is all about network interfaces and connectivity. Finally, Lab 3 dives into layer-3 routing features, Free Range Routing (FRR), and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) unnumbered.

Jorge García created the Educational Network Simulator. It is a very simple educational network simulator intended to be used with his 15-16 year old students. Jorge provides a series of YouTube videos explaining how it works and how to use it.

Pretty epic run using 
@go_containerlab
 as a test bed for my netcad project.  Used netcad to built the containerlab topology from the design, built the startup-configs, deployed the containers, and then validated the operating state.  Video coming soon:
