% Open-source network simulation roundup 2024

I updated the status of the open-source network simulation and network emulation projects tracked in this blog. I found no new projects to add to my lists in 2023 or early 2024. I also did not have to delete any projects because they all seem to have an acceptable level of support in 2024. 

Read the rest of this post for information about the latest open-source network simulator releases, as of the end of February, 2024.
