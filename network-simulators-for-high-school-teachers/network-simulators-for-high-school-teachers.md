Educators in secondary schools, who teach students aged 13 to 18, have unique needs for a network simulator. Most would require a simulator or emulator that offers a web interface so students can access it from a web browser running on a Chromebook or iPad. Ideally, the simulator should enable educators to demonstrate fundamental networking topics without requiring students to spend too much time learning to use the tool or to configure virtual network appliances in the tool.

Most of the projects listed below animate the basic functions of a communications network in a way that is easier for young students to understand. While they may not be interesting to a networking professional, they solve problems that educators may have.

### Free and open-source simulators

The following set of network simulators is free and open source. The first two projects, ENS and CS4G, are available via a web browser. 

#### Educational Network Simulator

The [Educational Network Simulator](http://malkiah.github.io/NetworkSimulator/) is a very simple educational network simulator intended to be used with 15-16 year old students. It has a [web interface](http://malkiah.github.io/NetworkSimulator/simulator01.html). The source code is available on GitHub. The author provides a series of YouTube videos explaining [how it works and how to use it](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx8u37tswCijgs5fGrKyCzOQ78uFZ3SMO).

#### CS4G Network Simulator

[CS4G Netsim](https://netsim.erinn.io/) is a Web-based network simulator for teaching hacking to high schoolers. It demonstrates some basic security issues that Internet users should be aware of. The [source code](https://github.com/errorinn/netsim) is posted on GitHub. This seems to have been a university student's project, presented as a [conference paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/ase17/workshop-program/presentation/atwater).

#### Filius

[Filius](https://www.lernsoftware-filius.de/Herunterladen) is a program designed to teach students about the internet and its applications. It is a standalone application for Windows, Mac and Linux. The project offers [Filius introduction e-book](https://www.lernsoftware-filius.de/downloads/Introduction_Filius.pdf) and a [full set of resources](https://www.lernsoftware-filius.de/Begleitmaterial) that help teach students basic network knowledge. The [source code](https://gitlab.com/filius1/filius) is available on GitLab.

#### Psimulator2.5

[Psimulator2.5](https://github.com/lager1/psimulator2.5) is a Java application that demonstrates basic network functions in a dynamic way.  It allows students to build virtual network consisting of PCs, routers, and switches. The [source code](https://github.com/lager1/psimulator2.5) is available on GitHub. See my [posts](https://www.brianlinkletter.com/tag/psimulator2/) about the older version of this tool, Psimulator2.

### Registration required

The following list of simulators is available via a web browser, but they require student registration.

#### Code.org

[Code.org's Internet Simulator](https://studio.code.org/s/netsim/) is web-based tool combined with a hosted [learning program](https://code.org/educate/csp) offered by [code.org](https://code.org/). It is not open-source. 

#### PT Anywhere

[PT Anywhere](https://pt-anywhere.kmi.open.ac.uk/) is a network simulator based on Cisco Learning Academy's Packet Tracer and made available via a [free training course](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/digital-computing/discovering-computer-networks-hands-on-the-open-networking-lab/content-section-overview?active-tab=description-tab) offered by the [Open Networking Lab](https://onl.kmi.open.ac.uk/). It is not open-source.

### Commercial Simulators

#### NetSim Academic

[NetSim Academic](https://tetcos.com/netsim-acad.html) is a commercial network simulator that requires a paid license. It is available as an application or as a [web-based service](https://tetcos.com/blog/2020/09/).

The [NetSim Experiment manual](https://www.tetcos.com/downloads/v13.2/NetSim_Experiment_Manual.pdf) provides good learning resources for students. This is a full-featured tool that advanced secondary-school programs may find it usable, but it may be more suitable for universities. Unfortunately, you must contact a salesperson to find out the cost.

### Conclusion and recommendation
