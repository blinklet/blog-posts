With the intensive development of services provided via the Internet, as well as the number of users and their requirements to the quality of services, it became clear that the existing infocommunication technologies do not meet these requirements. Therefore, on the one hand, the task has become to develop more relevant network technologies, mechanisms and protocols. And on the other hand, with the complication of technologies, there is a need to simplify and accelerate the implementation of these technologies by the possibilities of virtualization. SDN and NVF concepts [1]–[5] have been developed to realize the possibilities of virtualization of network functions. The work is devoted to the development of advanced routing methods based on the SDN concept and OS Linux.

This diploma thesis aims at presenting the “Network in a box”, an innovative tool we developed which is based on the key 5G principles, SDN and NFV. With Software Defined Networking (SDN) being the new approach in mobile networks, control and data plane are decoupled providing the ability to make any control related decisions centrally and transform legacy network devices to simple forwarding elements. This testbed is a portable emulated network device which is self-managed and self-optimised and can be connected between any real network devices, emulating how the 5G network will perform. This plug & play black-box testbed is also capable of providing KPI metrics of the 5G network under real circumstances when real network devices are connected to it.

Communication Network is an ever-evolving field as new technologies that connect the world are adopted. There are many distinct types of networks, each of which is classified differently. Cellular networks are currently experiencing data explosion because of the ever-increasing bandwidth demands of today's mobile applications. This has resulted in traffic congestion and a scarcity of resources. The network must handle a high volume of traffic and serve many customers, which may result in poor service quality for users. A single access network struggles to handle such a tremendous volume of traffic. In this paper we present a traffic offloading and load balancing algorithm between cellular and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) networks, to enhance the overall utilization of cellular network. The proposed algorithm uses software defined network (SDN) controller for making decisions of offloading users from a cellular network to a WLAN network, and to balance the load across access points (APs). Simulation results shows that the proposed data offloading scheme improves load distribution and throughput.

Industry 4.0 revolution has emerged as an escalator for increased productivity and cost savings in smart factories. However, they pose a big challenge for network architecture in providing a flexible way for continuous data flow. The necessity of reliable connectivity in the industrial ecosystem has paved the path for the evolution of software-defined industrial networks. However, the nature of data traffic in the industrial environment further pushes the need for adaptive flow forwarding and control. Therefore, in this article, AdaptFlow, an adaptive flow forwarding scheme, is designed for software-defined industrial networks. AdaptFlow includes: 1) application-specific traffic classification using self-organized maps; 2) B+ tree-based flow table management; 3) queuing model for analyzing the waiting time; and 4) energy-aware flow forwarding algorithm. The evaluation of AdaptFlow scheme shows improvements in minimizing delay and energy consumption while increasing network capacity in contrast to the OpenFlow architecture.

Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a rapidly evolving technology in the field of networking. It allows the computer networks to be managed via software instead of hardware devices. It gives the benefit of simplicity in management and easiness to apply new features in the network. Thus scalability, performance and maintainability become more sophisticated compared to the legacy hardware driven networks. But the SDN has more chances of being attacked by hackers, thus compromising the entire network. One common such threat is Denial of Service (DoS). Apart from such attacks in the legacy networks, the DoS attacks can be aimed at the SDN controller, Openflow switch and the controller-switch link by exhausting their resources. This paper proposes a novel and simple method to detect and mitigate such attacks through a Heavy Packet-in Flow Mitigation feature. Also it introduces an add-on feature ARP Flood Rule to reduce the number of ARP packets during the network initial boot up time. With both the features enabled, the network can reduce the packet-in flows to the controller and rescue the controller from overwhelming with huge packet-in message processing

The system proposed in this paper is the development of a methodology for a Network Vulnerability Assessment (NVA) tool capable of scanning and reporting vulnerabilities over the intranet and network simulator for enterprise networks which is capable of analyzing network behavior using enhanced GNS3. The proposed NVA tool implements network function in a controller which has the potential to extend vulnerability scanning for any devices. We had tested the system using a test bed with the features like scanning various vulnerabilities based on the type of networking device from the controller/vulnerability scanner in the same network. We have automated telnet/SSH connection using python script, which can help in automation and integrate network programming features from a controller. This version of the tool can be used to identify the possible vulnerabilities in any enterprise network and the methodology can be extended to incorporate better-secured networks.

In today's digital age there is a great need for smart and experienced networking professionals. In order for someone to become a network expert, in addition to theoretical knowledge, it is necessary to acquire practical skills. One way of acquiring practical skills is to use real facilities in a specialized network laboratory. Such laboratories are being built to provide a variety of network equipment and technologies that specialists can encounter in practice. However, building network laboratories is too time-consuming and, last but not least, costly. Although working on real facilities brings many advantages, we will ultimately find a few limitations in most laboratories. The constraints associated with a network laboratory may vary, but the biggest problem is in terms of flexibility, financial requirements, and overall sustainability of the operation of such a laboratory. For several years, the replacement of physical devices, whether computers or network devices, through virtualization has been developing intensively. Virtualization itself provides additional possibilities for more efficient use of hardware resources, allowing the development and deployment of new types of network laboratories and thus virtual network laboratories. It is sufficient to use general computer hardware with virtualization software to operate such a laboratory. We are convinced that virtual laboratories will become an integral part in studying and improving networking. Based on these facts, in the article we will focus on the analysis and description of available solutions of virtual laboratories, focusing on teaching process of the network subjects in college. The article offers an insight into how such laboratories are used in daily teaching process, as well as the experience or requirements of the laboratory that we have gained in their use.

Today, there is no sector where the internet is not used. As a result, a secure and sustainable internet connection has become a necessity in all areas of our lives. The management of online devices, which have become so widespread, also raises the security problem. Especially for institutions and organizations that are internet providers, it is of great importance to identify devices connected to the network, to process log files and to be traceable in any legal situation. In order to achieve this, institutions should be able to identify the personnel to whom they provide internet services, prevent unauthorized access and restrict access to web services outside the working area. Today, in order to achieve this, firewalls serve in institutions larger than a certain scale. In addition, Captive Portals are used for user identification. In this study, a Captive Portal application has been developed for university campus areas, taking İnönü University as an example. The developed application has been tested by producing different scenarios in Eve-Ng environment and user registration, authorization and internet access have been successfully simulated.

With the growth of the world-wide computer network and its use, it becomes necessary studies and abstractions of concepts used in the area. In this way a great demand arises for applications related to security, expansion and its maintenance. The definition of computer networks is given by the set of interconnected equipment in order to exchange information and share resources, such as files, printers, modems, software, among others. With this, in order to obtain and study the behavior of a network, a large amount of equipment and technical capacity for configuration is necessary, in the academic environment this necessity makes the study costly. Thus, an alternative to obtain a complete network environment is the simulation, where the equipment is not allocated physically, but in virtual form within a computer application, every necessary equipment or resource is created within that capable software to simulate a real machine. The simulation process brings several benefits, due to its low investment and better understanding. A simulated environment requires a reduced amount of physical equipment, and its configuration can be automated. In the activities carried out in the technology course in internet systems, at the Guarapuava campus of the Federal Technological University of Paraná, the lack of a visually intuitive and simple configuration environment was observed, where any academic or teacher can perform their simulations and tests, without lost most time in creating this environment. For this reason, the present work aims to describe the steps followed during the development of a visual tool for the control of virtualized equipment. Centralizing the configuration of computers, servers, switches and routers in a single tool.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an architecture that aims to make networks agile and flexible by introducing programmability in networks. In SDN, the functionality of the network device is divided into control plane and forwarding plane. At the control plane, the SDN Controller provides APIs which can be used by the applications. It gives the forwarding logic in the form of flow rules to the OpenFlow Switches, at the forwarding plane, to forward the packets. We propose to implement a centralized firewall for SDN which will get the network details from the SDN Controller, analyze it, and will push the rules to the SDN controller using RESTful APIs.

LOADS: Load Optimization and Anomaly Detection Scheme for Software-Defined Networks

The decoupling of control functionality from the forwarding devices to the control plane in Software-Defined Networks (SDN) provides a unique platform to design a programmable and reconfigurable network. A single controller due to its limited capacity and resources may not handle heavy load traffic generated from various smart devices. In order to handle this, multiple controllers need to be deployed at the control plane so as to ensure improved efficiency and scalability of the network. The data flow by the distributed controllers fluctuates frequently which results in an uneven load distribution amongst different controllers. So, to handle the aforementioned issues, in this paper, a Load Optimization and Anomaly Detection Scheme (LOADS) is proposed. Using LOADS, the probability of switch selection is determined using the following two factors (i) distance from the switch to the controller, and (ii) resource consumption ratio of the switch to its controller. Also, an IP flow-based network anomaly detection module has been designed to classify the traffic as malicious or normal. In order to address the network anomaly, the LOADS scheme uses Access Control Policies (ACPs) on the user's behavior in the network. The proposed scheme is evaluated on Mininet emulator using POX controller with datasets of Internet Topology Zoo from BTNorthAmerica zone.

Although initially the management of conventional networks could be met with a small demand for administrators, Their gradual growth has led to drawbacks such as lack of flexibility with regard to Programmability and the management of its elements. Having in account that software-defined or well-known networks as Software Defined Networking (SDN) are born as a model of study knowledge that focus in a different in the management and control of networks compared to the current one Operation of conventional networks. This article is focuses on comparing a conventional network versus an SDN network using GNS3 and Mininet, taking as comparison metrics: latency, packet loss and throughput, for this a Test network scenario with redundant and multiple links Hosts. When analyzing the data thrown by the different tests was able to show better performance of the network defined by software (SDN), as it presented an average delay of one 82.32% lower than the conventional network, thus determining the efficiency of SDN networks compared to a conventional network.

The education of networking professionals requires not only the knowledge of theory but also acquiring practical skills. For this purpose, specialized networking laboratories equipped with the required diverse technology have been built for years. However, building them is lengthy, expensive, and ultimately laboratories have several limitations, for example in terms of flexibility, sustainability, financial and energy demands, etc. In recent years has begun to intensively evolve the trend of virtualization, both networks as well as computers, that is allowing the development and deployment of more flexible types of virtualized lab solutions. Usually, a general computer hardware and virtualization software are used to operate them. We consider, that this trend of virtualization becomes important and decisive for the coming period. The article focuses therefore on a wider analysis and description of available virtualization solutions specifically aimed at the teaching of network-related university subjects and networking education. At the same time, the article offers a look at our way of using these tools in our everyday teaching process and what experience we have gained from their implementation and usage.

Many service providers need to provide many other functions than just a network connectivity. They also need to provide network functions such as network address translation, firewall, encryption, Domain Name Service (DNS), caching, routing and many other services. Usually these functions come with the hardware at the user or customer's premises. This can increase the revenue of the revenue, but also can cost a lot and also be extremely difficult to maintain. In traditional network architecture, it is very difficult to configure the network and later modify the configuration, since both the data plane and control plane are bound together. To address this issue, SDN exists which decouples the data and the control plane. However, within SDN there are also different types of failure with some existing solutions to these types of failure. A divide and conquer approach in the high-level architecture of SDN-based networks with a semi-global controller will be discussed. The semi-global controller will be responsible for any failure that a conventional distributed master-slave controller architecture cannot handle, allowing the system to have an extra layer of fault tolerance. The research will begin comparing the traditional networking with Software Defined Networking. Then looks at different fault domains in SDN. Next the solution playing on the high-level architecture of SDNs with a semi-global controller will be defined. Also, some metrics and results against the prepared prototype will be analyzed and compared with other existing fault tolerance solutions.

The single controller setup, in software-defined data center, is purposed to support dynamic load and scalability of switches. As such, multiple controller implementations become a promising approach to handle huge volumes of traffic. Co-locating the controllers along with switches becomes mandatory. In this article, we propose a controller placement model using independent dominating set, which identifies suitable positioning of controllers and assures minimum response time between controllers and switches. This creates an efficient switch to controller mapping with less latency. Since the control traffic influences the performance of software-defined network intensely. Moreover, with link energy as a metric, an energy aware routing mechanism, through the novel path ability component, is been proposed. It maintains the levels of path energy through which we route the traffic. Sustaining a unique module to maintain path energy metric increases the routing efficiency of the controller. Based on the dynamic update of path energy status, controllers periodically do the operations like switching off/on links and rerouting of packets. Traffic rerouting prevents congestion and avoids controller overhead during enormous traffic arrival. This adaptation ensures that our routing procedure utilizes less link energy during burst traffic compared to other existing approaches. The objective of this research work is to develop a controller placement model with an efficient routing strategy. It is capable of accomplishing low response time and prevents link energy depletion. The simulation outcomes indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves 70 to 227 watts less energy compared to the existing mechanisms with 52% increased throughput.

Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the heterogeneous network consists of vast number of connected devices. These networks need smart architecture to accommodate the expected increase of data generation. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) have gained popularity as a key enabler for automated provisioning and ease in IoT network resources management. For ubiquitous coverage, these network involve seamless handoff of the user devices ensuring the provision the services as per user demand. Although the basic inter-domain handoff rules exist in the next SDN domain are not sufficient to provide the primary domain services to the IoT networks. This issue leads to degradation of post-handover performance. In this paper, the SDN based Heterogeneous Inter-Domain Handoff system for IoT (SDN-HIIoT) is proposed that enables SDN-Controller to exchange flow rules by using the East/West application programming interface. The proposed system is using a process of hybrid flow rules execution on heterogeneous SDN domain for provision of Quality of Services (QoS) to mobile users the same as the primary domain. Experiment results are provided to demonstrate the proposed system can significantly improve the post-handoff performance and provides ubiquitous services.

In the modern scenario of cybersecurity, one uncomfortable truth is clear, the risk management of a company and/or institution in order to keep all its systems and information secure, is harder than ever. This management goes through a continuous cycle of identification, analysis, evaluation, and treatment of the daily threats. Usually risk management follows four steps, starting by the identification of the risk, then the evaluation of it with the probability of actors exploiting any existing vulnerability and the consequent impact. Given this analysis, the risks are prioritized and categorized depending on the mitigation strategy in place, and finally the last step is the monitorization, in other words, the structure that answers to the risk in an ever-changing environment. This Thesis has as objectives the development of a Risk Management web application that scans all the assets of a given network. This web application uses the framework Flask for its development and the open-source tool Nmap for the asset scanning and all the services running on each live host. For the detection of vulnerabilities, the application has a connection to the repository NVD through an API, and to the repository VulDB through another API, in order to identify all the existing vulnerabilities associated with the services found during the scan. All this information is stored on a SQLite database. According to the Portuguese law (109/2009), the use of the tool Nmap is strictly forbidden but can be authorized for use given the proper permission from the involved parties. The experiments use the virtualization software VirtualBox to simulate a network of a virtual Hospital that was already created in another project. All the results are in the end available as a report through the web application. This project was able to develop a functional risk management web application, capable of scan a network in order to find the vulnerable assets. Equally successful was the implementation of the vulnerability detection through the use of external vulnerability databases. Finally, this thesis successfully implemented a comparation between scans to discover which vulnerabilities have been corrected and which ones appear as new in specific assets. However, it was not possible to integrate in a successful way this application to an already existing project using React. Equally not accomplished was an automated way to schedule periodic scans. Finally, given the available resources, the hospital virtual network was largely reduced.
