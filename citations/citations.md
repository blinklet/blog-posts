With the intensive development of services provided via the Internet, as well as the number of users and their requirements to the quality of services, it became clear that the existing infocommunication technologies do not meet these requirements. Therefore, on the one hand, the task has become to develop more relevant network technologies, mechanisms and protocols. And on the other hand, with the complication of technologies, there is a need to simplify and accelerate the implementation of these technologies by the possibilities of virtualization. SDN and NVF concepts [1]–[5] have been developed to realize the possibilities of virtualization of network functions. The work is devoted to the development of advanced routing methods based on the SDN concept and OS Linux.

The system proposed in this paper is the development of a methodology for a Network Vulnerability Assessment (NVA) tool capable of scanning and reporting vulnerabilities over the intranet and network simulator for enterprise networks which is capable of analyzing network behavior using enhanced GNS3. The proposed NVA tool implements network function in a controller which has the potential to extend vulnerability scanning for any devices. We had tested the system using a test bed with the features like scanning various vulnerabilities based on the type of networking device from the controller/vulnerability scanner in the same network. We have automated telnet/SSH connection using python script, which can help in automation and integrate network programming features from a controller. This version of the tool can be used to identify the possible vulnerabilities in any enterprise network and the methodology can be extended to incorporate better-secured networks.

Today, there is no sector where the internet is not used. As a result, a secure and sustainable internet connection has become a necessity in all areas of our lives. The management of online devices, which have become so widespread, also raises the security problem. Especially for institutions and organizations that are internet providers, it is of great importance to identify devices connected to the network, to process log files and to be traceable in any legal situation. In order to achieve this, institutions should be able to identify the personnel to whom they provide internet services, prevent unauthorized access and restrict access to web services outside the working area. Today, in order to achieve this, firewalls serve in institutions larger than a certain scale. In addition, Captive Portals are used for user identification. In this study, a Captive Portal application has been developed for university campus areas, taking İnönü University as an example. The developed application has been tested by producing different scenarios in Eve-Ng environment and user registration, authorization and internet access have been successfully simulated.

With the growth of the world-wide computer network and its use, it becomes necessary studies and abstractions of concepts used in the area. In this way a great demand arises for applications related to security, expansion and its maintenance. The definition of computer networks is given by the set of interconnected equipment in order to exchange information and share resources, such as files, printers, modems, software, among others. With this, in order to obtain and study the behavior of a network, a large amount of equipment and technical capacity for configuration is necessary, in the academic environment this necessity makes the study costly. Thus, an alternative to obtain a complete network environment is the simulation, where the equipment is not allocated physically, but in virtual form within a computer application, every necessary equipment or resource is created within that capable software to simulate a real machine. The simulation process brings several benefits, due to its low investment and better understanding. A simulated environment requires a reduced amount of physical equipment, and its configuration can be automated. In the activities carried out in the technology course in internet systems, at the Guarapuava campus of the Federal Technological University of Paraná, the lack of a visually intuitive and simple configuration environment was observed, where any academic or teacher can perform their simulations and tests, without lost most time in creating this environment. For this reason, the present work aims to describe the steps followed during the development of a visual tool for the control of virtualized equipment. Centralizing the configuration of computers, servers, switches and routers in a single tool.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an architecture that aims to make networks agile and flexible by introducing programmability in networks. In SDN, the functionality of the network device is divided into control plane and forwarding plane. At the control plane, the SDN Controller provides APIs which can be used by the applications. It gives the forwarding logic in the form of flow rules to the OpenFlow Switches, at the forwarding plane, to forward the packets. We propose to implement a centralized firewall for SDN which will get the network details from the SDN Controller, analyze it, and will push the rules to the SDN controller using RESTful APIs.

The education of networking professionals requires not only the knowledge of theory but also acquiring practical skills. For this purpose, specialized networking laboratories equipped with the required diverse technology have been built for years. However, building them is lengthy, expensive, and ultimately laboratories have several limitations, for example in terms of flexibility, sustainability, financial and energy demands, etc. In recent years has begun to intensively evolve the trend of virtualization, both networks as well as computers, that is allowing the development and deployment of more flexible types of virtualized lab solutions. Usually, a general computer hardware and virtualization software are used to operate them. We consider, that this trend of virtualization becomes important and decisive for the coming period. The article focuses therefore on a wider analysis and description of available virtualization solutions specifically aimed at the teaching of network-related university subjects and networking education. At the same time, the article offers a look at our way of using these tools in our everyday teaching process and what experience we have gained from their implementation and usage.

Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the heterogeneous network consists of vast number of connected devices. These networks need smart architecture to accommodate the expected increase of data generation. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) have gained popularity as a key enabler for automated provisioning and ease in IoT network resources management. For ubiquitous coverage, these network involve seamless handoff of the user devices ensuring the provision the services as per user demand. Although the basic inter-domain handoff rules exist in the next SDN domain are not sufficient to provide the primary domain services to the IoT networks. This issue leads to degradation of post-handover performance. In this paper, the SDN based Heterogeneous Inter-Domain Handoff system for IoT (SDN-HIIoT) is proposed that enables SDN-Controller to exchange flow rules by using the East/West application programming interface. The proposed system is using a process of hybrid flow rules execution on heterogeneous SDN domain for provision of Quality of Services (QoS) to mobile users the same as the primary domain. Experiment results are provided to demonstrate the proposed system can significantly improve the post-handoff performance and provides ubiquitous services.

Risk management application for the cybersecurity field

Masters thesis

 Mestrado em Engenharia Eletrotécnica e de Computadores
In the modern scenario of cybersecurity, one uncomfortable truth is clear, the risk management of a company and/or institution in order to keep all its systems and information secure, is harder than ever. This management goes through a continuous cycle of identification, analysis, evaluation, and treatment of the daily threats. Usually risk management follows four steps, starting by the identification of the risk, then the evaluation of it with the probability of actors exploiting any existing vulnerability and the consequent impact. Given this analysis, the risks are prioritized and categorized depending on the mitigation strategy in place, and finally the last step is the monitorization, in other words, the structure that answers to the risk in an ever-changing environment. This Thesis has as objectives the development of a Risk Management web application that scans all the assets of a given network. This web application uses the framework Flask for its development and the open-source tool Nmap for the asset scanning and all the services running on each live host. For the detection of vulnerabilities, the application has a connection to the repository NVD through an API, and to the repository VulDB through another API, in order to identify all the existing vulnerabilities associated with the services found during the scan. All this information is stored on a SQLite database. According to the Portuguese law (109/2009), the use of the tool Nmap is strictly forbidden but can be authorized for use given the proper permission from the involved parties. The experiments use the virtualization software VirtualBox to simulate a network of a virtual Hospital that was already created in another project. All the results are in the end available as a report through the web application. This project was able to develop a functional risk management web application, capable of scan a network in order to find the vulnerable assets. Equally successful was the implementation of the vulnerability detection through the use of external vulnerability databases. Finally, this thesis successfully implemented a comparation between scans to discover which vulnerabilities have been corrected and which ones appear as new in specific assets. However, it was not possible to integrate in a successful way this application to an already existing project using React. Equally not accomplished was an automated way to schedule periodic scans. Finally, given the available resources, the hospital virtual network was largely reduced.

The objectives of this thesis were to identify potential shortcomings and areas for improvement in typical small and medium enterprise IT systems and to supplement the functionality of these systems with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure cloud services. The main purpose of the thesis was to provide a knowledge base constructed of the discussed topics and a testing environment for further studies. A theoretical comparison was made between the two cloud providers to help find the optimal CSP for each scenario. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were selected in order to delimit the broader theme to specific uses and environments. AWS and Azure were chosen among service providers due to their respective market dominance. Initial emphasis in the early stages of the work was on studying relevant documentation, and soon SMEs became the focus. The theory section also dealt with the subject matter of Amazon Web Services and the comparison between Azure and the two CSPs. In addition, the theoretical part emphasized business-specific infrastructure elements such as domains, virtual machines and networks, as well as system redundancy. The practical section included extending the local test environment, which relied heavily on Windows systems, over to the Azure cloud via IPsec site-to-site VPN, as well as created a Windows-based hybrid domain. The goals were mainly achieved, and the end result was a valuable documentation for the company commissioning the thesis, including a hybrid-domain testbed for further development. The work provides a good basis for working with the cloud environment and planning for further implementation.

This thesis aims at presenting SDN technology and then developing an SDN platform that monitors the network and makes changes in the paths to achieve better performance in the network in case of video streaming. More specifically, the developed SDN packet loss controller periodically monitors a networking parameter on the video packets transmission path and collects statistics, based on which, it calculates a value that is used to change the forwarding path if needed. As a next step, the Quality of Experience (QoE) related metric Peak to Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) is calculated. If it is found that if the value is more than a predefined threshold, the framework changes the transmission path, and thus the PSNR quality metric raises.

This project aims to implement both a traditional link-state routing protocol (LSR) and a modified delay-tolerant version (DTLSR) in order to investigate how both protocols perform in unreliable network conditions involving link and node failures. I aim for DTLSR’s modifications to both maximise the packet delivery rate and to minimise the end-to-end packet delay

The project aims to create a virtual platform for the dynamic analysis of malware samples through sandboxing. For this purpose, a virtual network topology is created with EVE-NG, a network emulation application, while within the network a sandbox machine is installed. Furthermore, a number of virtual machines with different levels of hardening with anti-evasion techniques have been set up and are dynamically infected with malware. In addition, honeypots running several services, such as FTP and several web services, have been installed. This topology is configurable, meaning that the network architecture and the virtual machines and services can be modified. This setup allows the researchers to monitor the behavior of the malware and capture its network activity in a controlled environment. The preliminary results show that when a malware infects a machine with a higher level of hardening, it has more active behavior and triggers more detection signatures.

An air Quality Monitoring System was Designed and Developed Through the Implementation of an Lot Temperature. A Waspmote Card Was Chosen For its Implementation Along With Sensors To Measure The Variables Of Co, Temperature And Humidity, A Raspberry Card To Send The Data To The Internet, the Google Firestore Database Platform to Store Such Data, and The Design of a Progressive Web Application (Pwa) To View Them. A Level Measurement Method Was Used, Where The Modular Equipment Was Placed at Different Levels of Proximity (With Respect To The Patient) And at Different Heights. The Measurements Were Made in 8 Different Rooms, Collecting a Total of 14500 Samples In 38 Hours Of Operation (For 9 Days). in The Analysis of the Measurements, Allowed Co Values Were Detected in All Rooms, But Not in the Temperature and Humidity Variables, Which in Some Places Were Above The Recommended. Likewise, Significant Differences Were Found In The Levels of co, Temperature And Humidity When Measured at Different Heights With Respect to The Floor, Results That Can be Analyzed in Future Projects

In the fast moving space of technology, everything and everyone is on the Internet accessing the world. The creation of large networks and data centers required for managing and analyzing data will increase in the future, so traditional networking technologies and skills will not be enough to solve the future complications arising in the networking industry. The present networks are more static and rigid where else they need to be more dynamic and flexible. Software Defined Networking (SDN) pledges to solve these issues and change the status quo of the industry. The key ideas behind Software Defined Networking are the separation of control and data plane, centralization of network policies and programmability of the networks. Software Defined Networking also claims to solve the perplexing network management issues with some related technologies.
This paper provides an insight into this new paradigm. In the inception, we introduce Software Defined Networking and what exactly led to SDN. The fundamental difference between SDN and traditional networking is discussed next. Then, we discuss the different definitions of SDN proposed by different communities covering every aspect of this new paradigm namely: standardization efforts, history, architectural framework with three planes of networking, northbound and southbound interfaces, SDN controllers, and network applications. We also take a look at the ongoing research work especially from the eye of industry giants like Microsoft, Google, AT&T, etc. specifically in the field of deployment and interoperability among different carrier vendors and cloud service providers. We conclude the paper by explaining how SDN has brought the whole ecosystem under one roof.
